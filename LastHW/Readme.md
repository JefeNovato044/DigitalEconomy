## Describe the public acceptance of the technology.

Technology is a subject that sometimes co-merges a lot with the image of an artifact with lights and a lot of cables, basically technology is any artifact that helps the progression of the human being, that is, even a simple hammer that technology, of course , this was given for a long time but technology has almost always existed, only that it has been in different essences, the acceptance of technology has been something that cannot be denied today, technology has progressed gradually slowly that we do not realize that we are evolving and improving it, for us, every physical and digital artifact is already something of our daily life, it will continue to be improved over the years and we will not care since it is for our progression, of course issues have arisen as they can be dangerous for health and the like but something must be sure, humans will always use technology day by day.
 
## Describe the impact of social networks on information and communication tech (ICT) .

As we know many years ago, people used to communicate by telephones placed on the street, letters, faxes and the like, with the emergence of social networks, information and communication technology emerged exponentially, as we know the beginning of this was through the emails and later the famous social networks emerged. This has affected communication on a large scale in every sense since everything is done in a matter of seconds, a news item can go around the world in a matter of minutes. As we know, the most important thing that has been given thanks to social networks is the information that can be obtained, this has had a great impact that large amounts of data can be obtained to analyze and draw conclusions in the same way, special social networks have emerged to make people's lives easier, for example, Facebook and Twitter to share all kinds of random information, the famous social work networks to search for jobs, Instagram, YouTube. Without a doubt, social networks have taken over society and as we saw recently in the news, this can be left behind thanks to virtual reality.

## Identify skills for the use of ICT in work and life.

Not only does it serve to sit down and send some emails to say that you have the necessary skills for ICT, there are several skills that can normally be varied depending on who says it, it is not something from the other world that you have to have basic skills therefore we could say that some of the skills for both work and normal life are:
 
- Using a Computer and the Internet
This refers to the fact that we basically know how to use a computer or digital device since everything is born from there, in the same way on the internet it refers to search engines like Google since we must learn how to investigate using these tools
 
- Processing Information
We refer to being able to make the information have the correct meaning, that is, to be able to filter the information in such a way that the sender can understand what the complete message is
 
- Presenting Information
It is the ability to transmit information through x means and to be sane.

- Online Communication and Collaboration
 
Being able to have the ability to communicate as a work team or individual person in order to reach agreements.

## Describe the existing regulation in Employment, Ethics, politics and the data science related regulation.

For this section we can understand in a simple way what are the regulations given by companies and the government to protect information from possible malicious use. As we have already seen, today there is so much information that can be put together with which various types of crimes can be made to people or companies in general, therefore, there are several laws and regulations that support the integrity of the data for its exclusive use. There are basic regulations to take the necessary care about the information, for example, that the origin of the information obtained is legal and real, this means that any type of information that we share has a real antecedent with well-built bases, on the other hand there is the moral decision, that is, in the aspect of data science sometimes advanced models usually make predictions but do not have the moral that a person has, therefore, you do not always have to trust computer decisions, rather, we must take care of the final decision we make. Privacy is another very important issue, all information obtained should respect people's private information, that is, all information that can be used against the person must be used in a moral way if used. In the same way, we must take care of the things we share, it is ethics on the internet, as we know the internet is usually a site open to all public and normally everything that remains on the internet is very difficult to erase, therefore all Information shared has to be seriously reviewed.
